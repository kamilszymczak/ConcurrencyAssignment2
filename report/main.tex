\section{Comparison of Different Methods Used to Achieve Synchronization}

\subsection{Efficiency Vs. responsiveness}


When developing our solutions we have experienced significant differences between the results on a system by system basis. We have selected a single system to run all the tests on, so that their relative performance in that environment can be compared. The system in question has a 4 core 4.5Ghz i7 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and is running the latest version of Windows 10. It is important to emphasize that the tests are not representative of anything beyond the system they ran on.

The table below shows the average time in seconds to complete 5 runs of the tests, for each of the sync classes. A description of each test and the full test results have been provided in the appendix: 

Thus a direct ranking based purely on an efficiency perspective results in the following ranking: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Intrinsic
	\item Semaphore \& Atomic
	\item Extrinsic
\end{enumerate}


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Test Name & Atomic & Intrinsic & Extrinsic & Semaphore \\ \hline
1A        & 23.364 & 8.393     & 47.181    &           \\ \hline
1B        & 0.815  & 0.690     & 0.719     &           \\ \hline
2A        & 0.127  & 0.124     & 0.125     &           \\ \hline
2D        & 2.040  & 1.738     & 1.753     &           \\ \hline
3A        & 1.794  & 2.630     & 2.624     &           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
